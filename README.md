Comply is a SOC2-focused compliance automation tool:

- **Policy Generator**: markdown-powered **document pipeline** for publishing auditor-friendly **policy documents**
- **Ticketing Integration**: automate compliance throughout the year via your existing **ticketing system**
- **SOC2 Templates**: open source policy and procedure **templates** suitable for satisfying a SOC2 audit

## Running in Docker

Comply is currently only released for Linux and macOS, however from other operating systems it's possible to run using Docker:

```
# first pull the latest published docker image
$ docker pull strongdm/comply

# from an empty directory that will contain your comply project
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/source -p 4000:4000 -it strongdm/comply
root@ec4544732298:/source# comply init
âœ— Organization Name:

# serve content live from an established project
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/source -p 4000:4000 -it strongdm/comply
root@ae4d499583fc:/source# comply serve
Serving content of output/ at http://127.0.0.1:4000 (ctrl-c to quit)
```

For Windows users, replace $PWD with the full path to your project directory


## Ticketing Integrations:
- Jira
- Github
- Gitlab

## Configuring Jira
When comply creates a ticket (through `proc`, for instance), it sets the following fields.

- assignee
- description
- issuetype
- labels
- project key
- reporter
- summary

Please make sure that the default *Create Screen* has all of those fields enabled. Additionally, make sure that there are no other required fields for the issue type you choose.




## Forking and local development
> Assumes installation of golang and configuration of GOPATH in .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc
> Inspiration: http://code.openark.org/blog/development/forking-golang-repositories-on-github-and-managing-the-import-path

```
$ go get github.com/strongdm/comply
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/strongdm/comply ; go get ./...
$ make
$ cd example
$ mv comply.yml.example comply.yml
$ ../comply -h
$ ../comply sync
$ ../comply serve
#
$ make # recompile as needed with in $GOPATH/src/github.com/strongdm/comply
